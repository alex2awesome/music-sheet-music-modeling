(5) Please spend time with internal documentation -- text-file
    descriptions of how each program works, a sketch of the
    algorithm, tips and warnings to other programmers.  Libraries
    invoked, make-files, and other pertinent details.
    As sobering as it may seem, it is possible that "yours truly"
    will have to try making modifications.

(7) The "simil" program was written by Keith Orpen.  It is a
    fine program that needs to be included with the toolkit.
    However, at the time it was designed, humdrum didn't
    distinguish exclusive and tandem interpretations.  Even if it
    takes you a couple of days, it is a high priority to have this
    program recompiled.  Ask me to help you with this, since I
    know where the files are, and am interested in seeing how
    it's done.

RECORD -- BUGS & OBSERVATIONS:

When you add a second spine (e.g. switch from Channel 1 to Channel 2),
a null token is added to the data record before the spine-path
and interpretations are added: e.g.

**MIDI
*Ch1
39/-60/64	.
*+
*	**MIDI
*	*Ch2
.	 56/60/35
.	 28/62/51
.	 6/-60/64

etc.

Also, leading spaces are added to tokens in the other channels
(as illustrated above).
