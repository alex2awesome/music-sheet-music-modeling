	To test the files in this directory, run the shell scripts:

				errors.ksh and testing.ksh

	The file errors.ksh will invoke the current command so that any
error messages that are found within the shell script or the awk script
will be output (to standard error).

	The file testing.ksh will run all of the test files and compare them
to the corresponding output files.
