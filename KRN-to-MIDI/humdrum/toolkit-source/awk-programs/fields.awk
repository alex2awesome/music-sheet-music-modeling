##					FIELDS.AWK
# Programmed by: Tim Racinsky         Date: July, 1993
# Copyright (c) 1993 David Huron
#
# Modifications:
#    Date:   Programmer:         	Description:
# May 9/94	Tim Racinsky		Changed -u option to -r
# June 7/94	Tim Racinsky		Modified parse_command for getopts command
#
#
#	This program simply allows the user to obtain a listing of record
# numbers and the corresponding number of fields for that record for
# types of records that the user specifies on the command line.  Each
# line of input is also appended as a comment to each line of output. This
# program is called using 'fields.ksh'.
#	This program will usually be used in conjuntion with the extract2.awk.
#
#	The following gives a brief summary of the available options:
#
#	-g	signify global comments
#	-l	signify local comments
#	-s	sifnify spine-path interpretations only
#	-i	signify all interpretations
#	-r [regexpr] allow user to specify marker
#
#	For global comments, the number of fields output for the current
# line is equal to the number of fields for the most recent non-global
# comment record (held in variable current_no_of_spines).
#	For spine-path records, the current record as well as the next
# record are output so that the user knows the changes in the number of spines. 
#	This program assumes a valid humdrum file as input.
#
# Main Functions used
#	Parse_command()	Store_indiators()		Process_indicators()
#	Determine_print()
#
#	VARIABLES:
#
#  -spine_path_record:  flag to indicate if current interpretation record
#   is also a spine-path record.
#  -USER:  flag to determine if user has specified '-r' option.
#  -REGEXP:  holds regular expression if user specified '-r' option.
#  -options:  holds list of options that user has specified.
#  -print_next:  flag to determine if current record or next non-global
#   comment record should be printed (used for spine-path records).
#  -current_no_of_spines:
#
# (Note that it is possible for one line to be printed more than once!)?????
