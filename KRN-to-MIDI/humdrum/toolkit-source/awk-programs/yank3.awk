#   Date:      Programmer:       Description:
# June 7/94	Tim Racinsky	Modified parse_command to work with getopts
#
#
#	This program implements the 'n' option or, the 'numbered marker' option,
# of the yank program. It is called from the program yank.ksh.
# It allows the user to specify a 'marker' and a range of numbers which
# represent numbered occurrences of that marker in the input.
# As with all yank programs, comments and interpretations 
# within the yanked material are output as well as all interpretations 
# before the yanked material.
# It should be noted that the '$' as a part of a range has no meaning
# within this version of yank.
#
# Main Functions used:
#	Parse_command()			Determine_range()
#	Separate_number_range()		Start_printing()
#	Stop_printing() 			Determine_number_of_fields()
#	Store_indicators()			Process_indicators()
#
# Helper Functions used:
#	Print_records_to_cut()
#
#	VARIABLES:
#
#  -RANGE:  holds the range of data records to yank between each successive
#   pair of regular expression records that is specified by the user.
#  -REGEXP:  holds the regular expression to search for.
#  -COMMENTS:  flag showing if user specified '-c' option or not.
#  -PRINTING:  flag indicating whether or not records are currently being
#   printed or not.
#  -STORING:  flag indicating if records should be stored or not.
#  -FIRST_MATCH_FOUND:  flag indicating when first record with regular
#   expression that is supposed to be printed has been found.
#  -ZERO_RANGE:  flag indicating whether first match of regular expression
#   has been found or not (note difference between first match that is 
#   supposed to be printed and first match of any record).
#  -number_of_fields:  holds current number of active spines.
#  -current_array_index: holds index of last element in store_array.
#  -number:  holds the 'number' of the current regular expression.
#  -current_file:  holds the name of the current file being processed. 
#  -spine_path_record: flag indicating if current interpretation record
#   is also a spine-path record.
#
#	ARRAYS:
#
#  -store_array:  holds all records since the most recent record has been
#   printed (and could possibly be the last one).  It is used when the
#   flag STORING is true.
#  -records_to_cut:  holds the numbers of the measures that the user wishes
#   to yank.
