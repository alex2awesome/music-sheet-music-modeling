.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.in +2
The
.B "pf"
command is used to determine the
.I "prime form"
for any of five set-theory related inputs:
pitch (\f(CR**semits\fR), pitch-class (\f(CR**pc\fR),
normal form (\f(CR**nf\fR), interval-vector (\f(CR**iv\fR),
or Fortean set name (\f(CR**pcset\fR).
.sp 1
.sp 1
\(odPrime form\(cd is a standardized way of representing the
symmetrical interval structure for any arbitrary set of pitch-classes.
Prime form is the most intervalically compact representation of a
pitch-class set, transposed to begin on pitch-class 0 -- where
inversions are deemed equivalent.
By way of example, any major or minor chord, having any root, in any inversion,
consisting of any number of notes, with any spelling, will have the
prime form: 0,3,7.
See \s-1REFERENCES\s+1 below.

.sp 1
When provided with \f(CR**semits\fR or \f(CR**pc\fR inputs,
.B "pf"
treats each input record as a set of pitches.
Unisons and other pitch-class duplications have no effect on the output.
Rests within a set of pitches are ignored;
where an input record consists solely of one or more
rests, a null-token is output.
The
.B "pf"
command can also accept other set theoretic inputs, such as
\f(CR**nf\fR, \f(CR**iv\fR, \f(CR**pcset\fR, as well as
\f(CR**pf\fR itself.

The following table identifies the input representations accepted by
.B "pf."
For descriptions of the various input representations
(including \f(CR**pf\fR) refer to Section 2
.I "(Representation Reference)"
of this reference manual.

It is recommended that output files produced using the
.B "pf"
command should be given names with the distinguishing `.pf' extension.
