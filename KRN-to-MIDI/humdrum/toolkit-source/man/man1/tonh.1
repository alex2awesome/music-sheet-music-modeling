.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.in +2
The
.B "tonh"
command transforms various pitch-related inputs to the corresponding
German system for designating pitches (Tonh\o'o\(..'he).
It outputs one or more Humdrum \f(CR**Tonh\fR spines.
German pitch designations are similar to the common A-G designations
used by English speakers.
The letter `H' signifies the English `B', whereas the letter `B'
signifies English `B-flat'.
Sharps and flats are indicated via the suffixes \(odis\(cd and
\(odes\(cd respectively -- hence `Cis' for `C#' and `Ges' for `Gb'.
Special exceptions include `Heses' for B double-flat rather than `Bes',
`As' and `Es' rather than `Aes' or `Ees', and `S' as an alias for `Es' (E-flat).
.sp 1

The
.B "tonh"
command is able to translate any of the pitch-related
representations listed below.
In each case, a tuning standard of A4 equals 440 hertz is assumed.
For descriptions of the various input representations
(including \f(CR**Tonh\fR) refer to Section 2
.I "(Representation Reference)"
of this reference manual.
.sp 1
.sp 1
It is recommended that output files produced using the
.B "tonh"
command should be given names with the distinguishing `.tnh' extension.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.in +2
The
.B "tonh"
command provides the following options:
.sp 1
.TS
l l.
\fB-h\fR	displays a help screen summarizing the command syntax
\fB-t\fR	suppresses printing of all but the first not of a
	  group of tied \f(CR**kern\fR notes
\fB-x\fR	suppresses printing of non-Tonh data
.TE
.sp 1
Options are specified in the command line.
.sp 1
.sp 1
The
.B "-t"
option ensures that only a single output value is given for tied \f(CR**kern\fR notes;
the output coincides with the first note of the tie.
.sp 1
.sp 1
In default operation,
.B "tonh"
outputs non-pitch-related signifiers in addition to the Tonh\o'o\(..'he value.
For example, the \f(CR**pitch\fR
token \(odGb5zzz\(cd will result in the output
\(odGes5zzz\(cd -- that is, after translating Gb5 to Ges5,
the \(odzzz\(cd signifiers are retained in the output.
For some applications, echoing non-pitch-related signifiers in the output
is useful.
However, in other situations, the result can prove confusing --
especially, when the non-pitch-related signifiers are numbers.
Consider the case of the \f(CR**kern\fR token \(od8aa#\(cd;
after translating `aa#' to Ais5, the non-pitch-related signifier `8'
will also be output, hence the value 8Ais5 -- which may cause
confusion.
Commands such as
.B "pitch"
and
.B "tonh"
treat the first number encountered in an input token
as the octave designation.
So further processing of this token may lead to it's interpretation as A#8
-- or even A#85 -- rather than A#5.
.sp 1
.sp 1
The
.B "-x"
option is useful for eliminating non-pitch-related signifiers from the output.
For most \f(CR**kern\fR inputs, the
.B "-x"
option is recommended.

The following example illustrates the use of
.B "tonh."
The input contains six pitch-related spines -- two of which (\f(CR**degree\fR
and \f(CR**cocho\fR) cannot be processed by
.B "tonh."

.TE
.sp 1
Both processed and unprocessed spines are output.
Notice that the tied note at the beginning of measure 2 in the \f(CR**kern\fR
spine has been rendered as a single note rather than as two notes
(due to the
.B "-t"
option).
Also notice that the non-pitch-related signifiers (e.g. foo)
in the first notes of the \f(CR**pitch\fR and \f(CR**MIDI\fR
spines have been stripped away (due to the
.B "-x"
option).
In the case of the \f(CR**degree\fR input,
.B "tonh"
recognizes the spelling of various pitches in the context of the key of
D minor.
Hence, the raised third degree is Fis (F#), and the raised sixth degree
is H (B natural).
