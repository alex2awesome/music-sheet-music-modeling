MIDRESET  : Reset MIDI controller card.

     This command resets the MIDI controller card.  The MIDRESET command is
     useful if a MIDI application has terminated abnormally -- leaving the
     MIDI card unaccessable to further use. 

     This command is for use on DOS systems only.  The MIDI card should be
     compatible with the Roland MPU-401 standard.
