PERL scripts
====================

This directory contains PERL scripts which utilize Humdrum Extras (and/or Humdrum Toolkit)
commands.  These scripts are linked to the ../../bin directory when the Humdrum Extras
tools are compiled.  To see if they are accessible in your terminal, type:

```bash
which sortcount
```

The computer should reply with the location of the `sortcount` script.  If it replies
with nothing, then the scripts are not installed.
